# Project Memory

This file is a persistent index of key project documentation that should be kept in the repository for future contributors and future agent runs.

## Remember these docs

- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — contributor workflow, local setup, code conventions, and pre-submit checks.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — application stack, source layout, data flow, and domain model overview.
- `DATABASE.md` — Supabase/Postgres operational notes, realtime requirements, and schema consistency guidance.

## Maintenance rule

When implementation details, workflows, or schema behavior change, update the corresponding documentation file in the same PR so this project memory stays current.
